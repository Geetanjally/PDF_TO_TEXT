NoteScan
CHAPTER 3: PROBLEM STATEMENT

The problem addressed in this project is the lack of an end-to-end Al-powered system that
converts handwritten or scanned PDFs into structured, study-ready digital content.
Traditional OCR tools are effective for printed text but perform poorly on handwriting due to
variations in style, image quality, and noise. Moreover, most tools stop at raw text extraction
and do not provide meaningful summarization, structuring, or presentation features.
NoteScan is proposed as a comprehensive solution that integrates Computer Vision CV for
preprocessing, Deep Learning models for handwriting recognition, and Natural Language
Processing NLP for cleaning, summarization, and structuring. The system will also generate
PowerPoint slides and export results in multiple formats such as TXT, DOCX, PDF, and
PPTX.
3.1 Identification and Formulation of a Problem
Handwritten notes remain common in classrooms, workshops, and research settings, yet
digitizing them into usable formats is still challenging. Current limitations include:

e Inconsistent handwriting styles, lowering recognition accuracy.

e Low-quality scans with noise or skew.

e Unstructured outputs, where extracted text is not ready for study or presentation.
3.2 Need and Significance of Proposed Work
The proposed work is significant because it provides a complete Al-driven pipeline rather
than a single-step OCR tool. NoteScan enhances productivity, ensures multi-format export
and cross-device access, and caters specifically to educational and professional needs,
making it more impactful than existing systems.
