NoteScan
CHAPTER 6: CONCLUSION

NoteScan provides an innovative step forward in digitizing and structuring handwritten and
scanned notes. Unlike traditional OCR systems that only extract raw text, NoteScan leverages
Computer Vision, NLP, and Deep Learning to deliver accurate recognition along with
structured and summarized outputs. This combination reduces manual effort, making study
materials and professional documents easier to prepare and share.
The systems ability to generate clean text, concise summaries, and even PowerPoint
presentations highlights its versatility. By integrating advanced summarization models like
BART and T5, NoteScan ensures that the content is not only digitized but also transformed
into meaningful, study-ready formats.
With its user-friendly interface, NoteScan caters to students, educators, and professionals
alike. As AI in EdTech continues to expand, this project demonstrates how technology can
improve productivity, accessibility, and efficiency, ultimately contributing to smarter and
more effective content digitization solutions.
