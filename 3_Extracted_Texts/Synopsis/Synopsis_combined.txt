NoteScan
CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
In todays academic and professional environments, a large volume of information continues
to be handwritten, particularly in classrooms, research discussions, and workshops. While
digital transformation has advanced rapidly, converting handwritten notes into structured,
reusable digital content remains a challenge. Traditional OCR Optical Character
Recognition systems work effectively for printed text but face major limitations with
handwritten inputs due to varied writing styles, inconsistent spacing, and noisy scanned
backgrounds.
NoteScan is designed to bridge this gap by providing an Al-powered solution that transforms
handwritten or scanned PDF notes into structured, study-ready formats. Unlike conventional
OCR tools, NoteScan integrates Computer Vision CV, Deep Learning DL, and Natural
Language Processing NLP techniques to go beyond raw text extraction. It converts scanned
handwriting into cleaned, structured notes, generates concise summaries, and even creates
ready-to-use PowerPoint slides. This makes it a complete academic assistant for students,
teachers, researchers, and professionals.
1.1 Features
e Automated Handwriting Recognition: Advanced OCR and deep learning models to
extract text from handwritten and scanned PDFs.
e Content Structuring: Intelligent grammar correction, segmentation, and formatting for
readability.
e Summarization  Notes: NLP-based summarization for bullet points and concise
study notes.
e PPT Generation: Automatic slide creation highlighting key points, diagrams, and flow
of concepts.
e Multi-format Export: Outputs in TXT, DOCX, PDF, and PPTX formats for wide
usability.
e User Interface: A Streamlit-based platform for easy uploads and direct downloads.

NoteScan
1.2 Advantages
e Time-Saving: Eliminates manual rewriting and structuring of handwritten notes.
e Multi-Format Support: Exports to multiple file formats for academic and professional
use.
e Accessibility: Cross-device support ensures that notes can be accessed anytime,
anywhere.
e Enhanced Usability: Summarization and presentation generation add value beyond
text recognition.
1.3 Disadvantages
e Accuracy may vary with extremely poor handwriting or low-quality scans.
e Requires internet access for cloud-based processing and NLP integration.
 Initial computational cost for deep learning models may be high.
1.4 Steps of Working
1, User uploads a scanned handwritten PDF.
2. Preprocessing techniques clean the input for better recognition.
3. OCR and deep learning models extract raw handwritten text.
4. NLP modules clean, summarize, and structure the content.
5. PPT slides and formatted study material are auto-generated.
6. User downloads outputs in multiple formats.
1.5 Architecture
e Frontend: Streamlit-based interface for uploads, previews, and downloads.
e Backend: Python-based pipeline integrating OCR Tesseract, Deep Learning models,
NLP transformers for summarization, text cleaning.
e Storage  Export: Files are processed and exported into TXT, DOCX, PDF, and
PPTX formats.

e NoteScan is not limited to academic use but can also benefit researchers, corporate
professionals, and institutions handling handwritten manuscripts or reports. Future
improvements may include multi-language handwriting support, mobile app
integration, and cloud storage synchronization.
1.7 Significance
This project represents a step forward in EdTech innovation, addressing the gap between
handwritten input and digital usability. By delivering structured notes, summaries, and

CHAPTER 3: PROBLEM STATEMENT

The problem addressed in this project is the lack of an end-to-end Al-powered system that
converts handwritten or scanned PDFs into structured, study-ready digital content.
Traditional OCR tools are effective for printed text but perform poorly on handwriting due to
variations in style, image quality, and noise. Moreover, most tools stop at raw text extraction
and do not provide meaningful summarization, structuring, or presentation features.
NoteScan is proposed as a comprehensive solution that integrates Computer Vision CV for
preprocessing, Deep Learning models for handwriting recognition, and Natural Language
Processing NLP for cleaning, summarization, and structuring. The system will also generate
PowerPoint slides and export results in multiple formats such as TXT, DOCX, PDF, and
PPTX.
3.1 Identification and Formulation of a Problem
Handwritten notes remain common in classrooms, workshops, and research settings, yet
digitizing them into usable formats is still challenging. Current limitations include:

e Inconsistent handwriting styles, lowering recognition accuracy.

e Low-quality scans with noise or skew.

e Unstructured outputs, where extracted text is not ready for study or presentation.
3.2 Need and Significance of Proposed Work
The proposed work is significant because it provides a complete Al-driven pipeline rather
than a single-step OCR tool. NoteScan enhances productivity, ensures multi-format export
and cross-device access, and caters specifically to educational and professional needs,
making it more impactful than existing systems.
