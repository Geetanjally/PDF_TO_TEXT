NoteScan
1.2 Advantages
e Time-Saving: Eliminates manual rewriting and structuring of handwritten notes.
e Multi-Format Support: Exports to multiple file formats for academic and professional
use.
e Accessibility: Cross-device support ensures that notes can be accessed anytime,
anywhere.
e Enhanced Usability: Summarization and presentation generation add value beyond
text recognition.
1.3 Disadvantages
e Accuracy may vary with extremely poor handwriting or low-quality scans.
e Requires internet access for cloud-based processing and NLP integration.
 Initial computational cost for deep learning models may be high.
1.4 Steps of Working
1, User uploads a scanned handwritten PDF.
2. Preprocessing techniques clean the input for better recognition.
3. OCR and deep learning models extract raw handwritten text.
4. NLP modules clean, summarize, and structure the content.
5. PPT slides and formatted study material are auto-generated.
6. User downloads outputs in multiple formats.
1.5 Architecture
e Frontend: Streamlit-based interface for uploads, previews, and downloads.
e Backend: Python-based pipeline integrating OCR Tesseract, Deep Learning models,
NLP transformers for summarization, text cleaning.
e Storage  Export: Files are processed and exported into TXT, DOCX, PDF, and
PPTX formats.
