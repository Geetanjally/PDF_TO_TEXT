NoteScan
CHAPTER 5: Methodology
5.1 Input Acquisition
ce Users upload scanned handwritten PDFs.
o PDFs converted into images using PyMuPDF or pdf2image.
5.2 Preprocessing Computer Vision
o Applied using OpenCV.
ce Techniques:
m Noise removal
m Thresholding
m Skew correction
ce Purpose: To improve OCR accuracy.
5.3 OCR  Text Extraction
ce Baseline Model: Tesseract OCR for printed text.
ce Advanced Models: CRNN and TrOCR for handwritten text.
o Enables recognition across varied handwriting styles.
5.4 Text Cleaning  NLP Processing
ce Libraries: NLTK, SpaCy.
 Tasks performed:
m Tokenization
m Stopword removal
m Lemmatization  POS tagging
m Named Entity Recognition NER
 Outcome: Clean, structured, and grammatically consistent text.
5.5 Summarization  Note-Making
eo Extractive Models: TextRank, BertSum.
co Abstractive Models: BART, T5.
