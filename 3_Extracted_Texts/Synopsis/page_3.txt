NoteScan
CHAPTER 1: INTRODUCTION
In todays academic and professional environments, a large volume of information continues
to be handwritten, particularly in classrooms, research discussions, and workshops. While
digital transformation has advanced rapidly, converting handwritten notes into structured,
reusable digital content remains a challenge. Traditional OCR Optical Character
Recognition systems work effectively for printed text but face major limitations with
handwritten inputs due to varied writing styles, inconsistent spacing, and noisy scanned
backgrounds.
NoteScan is designed to bridge this gap by providing an Al-powered solution that transforms
handwritten or scanned PDF notes into structured, study-ready formats. Unlike conventional
OCR tools, NoteScan integrates Computer Vision CV, Deep Learning DL, and Natural
Language Processing NLP techniques to go beyond raw text extraction. It converts scanned
handwriting into cleaned, structured notes, generates concise summaries, and even creates
ready-to-use PowerPoint slides. This makes it a complete academic assistant for students,
teachers, researchers, and professionals.
