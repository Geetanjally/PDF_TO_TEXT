DATA MINING
Introduction-
DATA Mining Concepts -
Data Mining - Data Mining is the process of extracting insights
from large datasets using statistical and
computational tectiriques,
It can involve structured, Semi-structured
ar unstructed data stored in databases,
data warehouses or data lakes.
Data mining involves many algorithms to accomplish different
tasks.

DATA MINING- It is the process of extracting useful
insides and knowledge from large datasets.
It involves applying techniques like statistics, ML and
database systerns to find hidden patterns relationshi-
ps and trends.
There insides help them to solve business problems in
2 processes, and make future predictions.

③ Predictive Modeling.
It is widely used across industries like finance, healthcars
retail and telicommunication to make informed decisions.
The core components of this field are ML, Statics,
