📌 Step 1 — Start with Extractive Techniques (Foundation)**

These do NOT generate new text.
They only **pick important sentences**.

### **1️⃣ TextRank (First) — Easiest**
* Graph-based
* No deep learning
* Helps you understand summary **ranking**
* Useful for simple bullet points

✔ Start here.
Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
### **2️⃣ BERTSum (Next) — Extractive Using BERT**
* BERT encoder + classifier to select important sentences
* More accurate than TextRank
* Gives you idea of **transformer-based extractive summarization**

✔ Study after TextRank.


## **📌 Step 2 — Move to Abstractive Techniques (Generation Models)**

These models **rewrite**, paraphrase, and generate text.

### **3️⃣ T5 (Third) — Best Starting Point for Abstractive Summaries**
* Very flexible (“summarize:”, “explain:”, “rewrite:”)
* Easy HuggingFace usage
* Perfect for notes, bullet points, simplified text

✔ This should be your **first abstractive model**.


### **4️⃣ BART (Fourth) — More Advanced, Similar to T5**
* Also great for summarization
* But slightly heavier
* Provides more “human-like” summaries

✔ Study after T5.



📌 Full Recommended Sequence

1. TextRank (Extractive, Traditional) → understand basic summarization
2. BERTSum (Extractive + Transformers) → understand how transformers select sentences

3. T5 (Abstractive, Easy, Flexible) → start generating summaries and notes
4. BART (Abstractive, More Advanced) → learn higher-level text generation




Model choices & defaults
1. Fast/cheap baseline: TextRank → T5-base (CPU-friendly)
2. Better quality: BERTSum (extractive) + T5-large or BART-large (abstractive)
3. If documents are very long: use LongT5 / BigBird / Pegasus-Long or chunk+summarize+merge.
